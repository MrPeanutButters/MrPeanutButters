## 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Bebawy  

🔐 Cybersecurity Professional | SOC Analyst | Incident Response | Vulnerability Management  

I bring 15+ years of enterprise IT experience and hands-on SOC expertise through a fully operational homelab I designed and maintain. My focus is on detection, investigation, and remediation using enterprise-grade tools and workflows.

## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 🛡️ Homelab  

- **SIEM:** Splunk Enterprise (log ingestion, correlation, dashboards)  
- **IDS/IPS:** Suricata on Security Onion (network monitoring & rule tuning)  
- **Vulnerability Mgmt:** Nessus Essentials (scanning, prioritization, remediation validation)  
- **Attack Simulation:** Kali Linux (Hydra, Nmap, Metasploit)  
- **Endpoints:** Windows 10 victim VM w/ Sysmon telemetry  

### 🔎 Scenarios  

- Detected and documented brute-force attacks in Splunk (reduced detection time to <30s)  
- Tuned Suricata to cut false positives while catching reconnaissance scans  
- Validated vulnerabilities with Nessus, simulated exploits, and confirmed patch effectiveness  
- Produced SOC-style investigation reports and dashboards
