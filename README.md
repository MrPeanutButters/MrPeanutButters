## 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Bebawy  

🔐 Cybersecurity Professional | SOC Analyst | Incident Response | Vulnerability Management  

I bring 15+ years of enterprise IT experience and proven SOC expertise through hands-on practice in both enterprise environments and a fully operational homelab. My focus is on detection engineering, incident response, vulnerability management, and compliance—bridging IT operations with security to deliver measurable improvements in resilience.

## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 🛡️ SOC Homelab  
Replicating enterprise SOC Tier 1–2 workflows to sharpen detection, response, and documentation skills.

- **SIEM:** Splunk Enterprise (log ingestion, correlation, dashboards)  
- **IDS/IPS:** Suricata & Zeek on Security Onion (network monitoring, packet inspection, rule tuning)  
- **Vulnerability Mgmt:** Nessus Essentials (CVE scanning, prioritization, remediation validation)  
- **Attack Simulation:** Kali Linux (Hydra, Nmap, Metasploit)  
- **Endpoints:** Windows 10 victim VM with Sysmon telemetry  

#### 🔎 Key Scenarios  
- Reduced brute-force detection time to <30 seconds with Splunk correlation searches  
- Tuned Suricata rules to cut false positives by 40% while maintaining detection coverage  
- Validated and remediated 15+ vulnerabilities discovered by Nessus scans  
- Correlated host + network telemetry across Sysmon, Suricata, and Zeek for attacker context  
- Produced SOC-style incident reports mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
